# Deep_Learning_Motion_Deblur_Project
This project involves deblurring images taken from the MNIST dataset. The blurred version of an image is obtained through a superposition of slightly translated versions of the same image, following a random trajectory. This kind of blur is supposed to simulate the result of a shot taken with a shaky hand.
